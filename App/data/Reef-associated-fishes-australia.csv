Reports from off eastern Tasmania needs verification (Ref. 6871). Bronze whalers probably migrate following the warmer water southwards in the spring and summer and northwards in the autumn and winter. Migratory behaviour suggests a single stock in the area. Commercial fishery: The major commercial fishery is in Western Australia. In the southwestern area, bronze whalers are caught mainly with bottom set gillnets, bottom set longlines, droplines and handlines. Bronze whalers actually comprise only 5% of the combined catch for dusky and bronze whalers (Ref. 6871, 13841). In catch records they are often confused with dusky whalers. Since about 1976-80, fishing effort in the Southwest Shark Fishery in Western Australia has been increasing, reaching about 274% from 1980-81, and finally stabilising in 1987-88 (Ref. 13842). From then on until 1994, the Fishery has developed rapidly. Newly born and small juvenile bronze sharks are the prime target of the fishery, hence the annual variations in catch are probably dependent on the number of new recruits that are available to the fisheries (Ref. 6871, 13841, 13842). These species are also included as incidental catch of demersal otter trawling off southern Australia. In the South Australian inshore fishery, they are also caught in west coast bays, Spencer Gulf and Gulf of St. Vincent, off the Murray River mouth and the south-east coast. Bronze whalers are sold on local markets and their flesh is used in the fish-and-chip trade. Recreational fishery: Jetties such as at Giles Point and Rapid Bay in South Australia, and Lorne and Point Lonsdale in Victoria are frequented by gamefishers for catching bronze whalers. They use moderately heavy lines with wire or light chain traces, and gamefishing tackle. Resource status: Juveniles are mostly targeted in this fishery. However, the extent of the nursery areas is not known so the level of exploitation cannot be determined. There is little information on the status of the adults as well. Current levels of fishing may be sustainable probably if the stocks are not being fished over the extent of their range due to their migratory habits (Ref. 13842).

Also found in the Arafura Sea (Ref. 9819). Enters large coastal bays and inshore areas occasionally. Dusky whalers avoid estuaries and areas of low salinities (Ref. 244). Migratory behavior suggests a single stock in the area. Records of long migrations in Western Australia start from the region between Augusta and Shark Bay, then to as far away as Rowley shoals off the northwest coast and Esperance on the southeast coast (Ref. 13842). Dusky whalers migrate following the warmer water southwards in the spring and summer, and northwards in the autumn and winter. Seasonal, inshore-offshore movements also occur when pregnant females move from outer continental shelf regions onto the inner shelf to pup, and move back after giving birth. Commercial fishery: In Western Australia, major catch areas are from between the Albany and Busselton regions of the Southwest Shark Fishery. Dusky whalers are caught mainly with bottom set gillnets, bottom set longlines, droplines, and handlines. Newly born and small juveniles of around 100 cm TL are primarily exploited (Refs. 6871, 13842). In the South Australian inshore fishery, dusky whalers are caught in west coast bays, Spencer Gulf and Gulf St. Vincent, off the Murray River mouth and the southeast coast. Juveniles of less than 150 cm TL are caught with large mesh bottom set gillnets and bottom set longlines. They are sold fresh and frozen and is very popular in the fish-and-chip trade. Recreational fishery: Jetties such as at Giles Point and Rapid Bay in South Australia, and Lorne and Point Lonsdale in Victoria are frequented by gamefishers for catching dusky whalers. They use moderately heavy lines with wire or light chain traces, and gamefishing tackle. About 5% of all sharks caught by the New South Wales gamefishing clubs between Port Macquarie and Sydney are dusky whalers. Sharks belonging to family Carcharhinidae only comprise 24% of the total shark catch (Ref. 26106). Resource status: Juveniles are mostly targeted in this fishery. However, the extent of the nursery areas is not known so the level of exploitation cannot be determined. There is not much information on the status of the adults as well.

Also found in the Arafura Sea (Ref. 9819). Based on tagging and electrophoretic studies, there is only one stock of spot-tail sharks in Australian waters (Ref. 26278). Commercial fishery: Since the early 1970s, spot-tail sharks together with other shark species have been fished off in northern Australia. The Taiwanese gillnetters have been in huge operations until mid-1986 when limitations on gillnet length were introduced. Due to uneconomic yields, the Taiwanese gillnet fishery ceased operations within the Australian Fishing Zone. At about the same time, an Australian gillnet and a drifting longline fishery was in operations in Napier Broome Bay and eastern Gulf of Carpentaria. This is a relatively small fishery with a catch of about 500 t and is marketed in south-eastern Australia as 'flake'. Recreational fishery: Game fishers mostly from off Queensland usually catch small sharks of up to 2 m and 60 kg weight. Berley trail, heavy handlines with wire, and rod-and-reel are used for catching larger species. Other methods include trolling using lures and fish baits. Resource status: Stocks were overexploited based on the assessments of the Taiwanese catch and effort data in 1986 (Ref. 26279). From 1980-84, sustainable catch for the offshore shark fishery would have been about 2400 t live weight (Ref. 26274). Since 1986, sustainable catch estimates have improved when fishing effort had declined. The inshore northern region is probably only lightly exploited. No estimate is available on the impact of the catches by the demersal otter trawl fisheries on this resource. The Taiwanese and Indonesian gillnetting vessels continue to operate outside the Australian Fishing Zone to the north. Off the east coast of Queensland, the status of the whaler shark populations is not known. Also Ref. 2334, 7300, 9997, 33390. ",+

Recreational fishery: Recreational fisheries target large and small rock cod (eg Chinaman rock cod, E. rivulatus, and black-tipped rock cod, E. fasciatus) especially in inshore areas. They use lures, live bait or cut fish, jigs and deep-running troll lures. Rock cod can be hooked on single and double-handed casting tackle and jigs, or (for larger fish) heavy handlines.

They inhabit waters from the Recherche Archipelago off Esperance, to Beagle Island, although they are rare north of Shark Bay. Also Ref. 43239. Commercial fishery: Westralian jewfish are taken commercially off the Western Australian coast from Bremer Bay to Shark Bay, with the majority of the catch coming from the waters of the mid-west coast, off Geraldton. The main methods of capture are bottom set gillnets, droplines, bottom set longlines and handlines. The greatest part of the catch is taken by handline, with peak catches generally occurring between December and February, coinciding with the spawning season. Westralian jewfish are taken in gillnets and on longlines as bycatch of the Southwest Shark Fishery. Westralian jewfish are sold whole, or gilled and gutted. Recreational fishery: Westralian jewfish are taken by recreational fishers throughout their range and heaviest fishing effort centres on offshore reefs along the southern and southwestern coasts (Ref. 27560). The recreational Westralian jewfish catch is estimated to be greater than the commercial catch. They are fished throughout the year and their habit of migrating inshore in the cooler months makes larger fish more accessible (Ref. 27560, 27561). Experienced anglers suggest that the most productive time to fish for Westralian jewfish is late afternoon, through the night, and early in the morning. The main method used is boat-based handlining, either with the boat drifting, or by anchoring and berleying (Ref. 27560). Westralian jewfish rank with snapper (Pagrus auratus) as the fifth most popular fish targeted by anglers, and they are the most prized demersal species (Ref. 27560). The largest Westralian jewfish caught by a recreational fisher was 25.9 kg (records of the Australian Anglers Association). Resource status: The status of the resource is unknown. There is some evidence of increased fishing pressure in certain areas, where there has been a decrease in the average size of Westralian jewfish taken by anglers (Ref. 27560). The stock may be in danger of overfishing (Ref. 27621). ",+

More common in northern and northwestern Australia. Also known from the Torres Strait Islands (Ref. 13465) and Shark Bay (Ref. 115274). Commercial fishery: Emperors in general are caught by handlines, rod-and-line, traps and demersal otter trawling - mainly stern trawling but also semi-pelagic trawling in the Northern Territory. Emperors are trawled off northwestern and northern Australia. From 1970 (Ref. 28206, 28207) until 1991, Taiwanese and later Thai and Chinese fleets operated pair trawlers and stern trawlers on the North West Shelf and northern Australia. Emperors and butterfly bream (Nemipteridae) dominated catches on the North West Shelf for the 10 years from 1980 (Ref. 27275), peaking at a retained catch of 2200 t of emperor in 1982. Emperors were far less abundant in retained catches in the Timor and Arafura seas for the same period. The trawlers worked in depths between 30 m and 120 m, and concentrated on waters between 115° and 120°E (Ref. 28206). Domestic fishing interest in trawling in northern Australia commenced in 1985 and increased after 1988 (Ref. 28207). It is focused on grounds on the North West Shelf, the Arafura Sea and in the northern region of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Ref. 28207), and has a large seasonal component caused by prawn trawlers converted to fish trawling during the closed seasons of the Northern Prawn Fishery (Ref. 28207, 27275). Trap fishing began on the North West Shelf in 1984 (Ref. 28206, 27266). Fishing is carried out on hard-bottom areas to the west or inshore from main areas worked in the past by Taiwanese pair trawlers. It first concentrated on the Monte Bello-Barrow Island area mainly near the coastal towns of Onslow, Port Hedland and Point Samson (Ref. 27266, 28209). The main area for trapping is now north of Broome. Lethrinus lentjan comprised 64% of the emperor catch up to 1991 (Ref. 27275). In the Gulf of Carpentaria, L. lentjan, comprised an average 21% frequency in trawls (Blaker et al 1994). Fish traps used in Western Australia are mostly circular ('O' traps) and are baited usually with pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus). A small quantity of emperors are also taken by dropline. Most fish from the North West Shelf fishery are sent to Perth as whole, chilled fish. Some are gutted and brined before freezing. Recreational fishery: Emperors are caught with either fresh baits or whole or cut fish, crabs, prawns and squid, and tackle ranges from handlines to casting rigs. The largest emperor recorded by the Australian Anglers Association was 9.6 kg. from Queensland. The recreational fishery in Western Australia extends from the Houtman Abrolhos to Dampier Archipelgo. Resource status: Emperors comprised 47% of demersal fish in retained catches taken by Russian survey vessels on the North West Shelf between 1962 and 1973. Emperors and sea perch (Lutjanidae) comprised 40-60% by weight in 1962 but the amount dropped to about 10% in 1983 (Ref. 28206) (the emperor component of the total catch fell from 27.9% in 1967 to 5.4% in 1983 (Ref. 28006). This reduction in yield can partly be attributed to the removal of large epibenthos from the sea floor by the action of trawlers and to over-fishing these groups in the mixed species trawl fishery (Ref. 28206, 28207). The size composition also changed, with emperors (probably blue-spotted emperors, Lethrinus choerorynchus) larger than 0.6 kg disappearing from the catch after 8 months of fishing (Ref. 28006). By 1986, the catch per unit of effort for emperors had declined by 65% from a peak in 1973. Whereas the abundance of emperors has continued to decline in trawled areas, the catch rate has increased since 1986 due to concentration of fishing effort on emperors by Taiwanese fleets (Ref. 28207). As of 1993, there have been no studies on the resource status of emperors on the Great Barrier Reef and inshore areas of northern Australia. Similarly, there is no information on the resource status of emperors in Western Australian fisheries. Museum: WAMRL Leth Bali 6/83 (TGT2406). Also Ref. 5978, 2334, 33390, 38544. ",+

Red-throat emperors are targeted by handline fishers on the west coast. A small quantity of emperors are also taken by dropline. Red-throat emperors are caught in the North West Shelf Trap and Line Fishery, second only to spangled emperors (L. nebulosus) in abundance (Ref. 27266). Red-throat emperors are the third largest component of the Queensland East Coast Reef Line Fishery and comprise 14% of the catch or more than 500 t annually (Ref. 27263). On the Great Barrier Reef this species comprises more than 90% of the emperor catch. Catches of red-throat emperors are highest between August and October. They peak in the waters off Mackay, and are largely confined to waters between Cardwell and Shoalwater Bay, with small catches as far south as Maryborough. Spangled and red-throat emperors are the only emperors of significance on the Great Barrier Reef although red-spot emperors (L. lentjan) are caught in fish traps on the outer slopes of mid-shelf reefs (Ref. 27260). Red-throat emperors are caught with rod-and-line or handlines, baited usually with pilchards. Commercial vessels operate with 2-4 tender boats which anchor over coral 'bombies' to fish. Bottom fishing in Great Barrier Reef shallow lagoons at night catches mainly spangled emperors, and red-throat emperors are caught both in the daytime and at night. There is also a handline fishery for red-throat emperors in Norfolk Island waters. Best catches are taken in summer months between November and February (Ref. 6061). Most fish from the North West Shelf fishery are sent to Perth as whole, chilled fish. Some are gutted and brined before freezing. Recreational fishery: Red-throat emperors are 1 of the major target species by anglers on the Great Barrier Reef and the Queensland east coast.

Spangled emperors appear to be more common in outer coastal waters to the west and east of Australia than they are in the north (Ref. 6390). Recorded from Shark Bay (Ref. 115274). Stock structure: The taxonomic position of blue-spotted (L. choerorynchus), spangled and blue-lined (L. frenatus) emperors has been confused, with reviews (Ref. 2295, 2334) suggesting they are misidentifications for the 1 species. However, surveys and continuing studies consistently reveal morphological and ecological differences between them, and recent electrophoretic study (Ref. 28017) in Western Australia has confirmed that the 3 taxa are reproductively isolated species. Western Australian populations of blue-spotted emperors and spangled emperors have been shown to be single stocks, yet the relationship of these populations and blue-spotted and spangled emperors from other States is unknown.

In the shallow water (10-50 m) fishery in the Northern Territory, spangled emperors comprise up to 50% of the catch. Spangled and red-throat emperors are the only emperors of significance on the Great Barrier Reef although red-spot emperors are caught in fish traps on the outer slopes of mid-shelf reefs (Ref. 27260). Bottom fishing in Great Barrier Reef shallow lagoons at night catches mainly spangled emperors. Most fish from the North West Shelf fishery are sent to Perth as whole, chilled fish.

Emperors are caught with either fresh baits or whole or cut fish, crabs, prawns and squid, and tackle ranges from handlines to casting rigs. The largest emperor recorded by the Australian Anglers Association was 9.6 kg. from Queensland.

Stock structure: It is believed that there is probably a unit stock for red snapper species in northern Australian waters (Ref. 6390). More studies are needed to verify this. Commercial fishery: In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, red snapper are caught by demersal and semi-pelagic otter trawls, traps, droplines, and deepwaters handlines (Western Australia). In Queensland, they are also longlined. The fisheries operate all year. Red snapper are more commonly caught by trawling in northern waters. Sea perch (mainly 'redfish') were a dominant group of fishes in Thai and Taiwanese trawler catches in the Arafura Sea and Timor Sea, comprising up to 30% of the total catch; and between 1985 and 1987 on the North West Shelf, sea perch were the third most important fish group taken by demersal foreign trawling. The highest catches of 'redfish' per unit of effort by the foreign fleets in the period 1980-90 were achieved in the Arafura Sea and retained catches of 'redfish' per unit of effort by Taiwanese (and some Thai) trawlers of 100-150 kg/hour were common in the Timor Sea and higher in the Arafura Sea. The 'redfish' catch was dominated by saddle-tail snapper (70% by weight) and red snapper (24% by weight). Catches in the Timor Sea had a large component of red snapper (up to 670 t per year),and this species was also a major component of the Arafura catch (up to 3370 t per year) (Ref. 27275), where saddle-tail snapper is the dominant species taken. Red snapper are an incidental catch by the domestic Northern Fish Trawl Fishery which as of 1993, operated in depths of 30-70 m offshore from prawn grounds in the Arafura Sea only, with vessels based at Gove and Karumba. Juvenile red snapper are also a bycatch of the Northern Prawn Fishery. 'Redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are targeted primarily at night. Handlines, large, deck-mounted, hand-operated reels and bottom set longlines are used, and baits include squid, oily fish and lower quality reef fish (Ref. 27262). There was an increase as of 1993, in the red snapper catch in Queensland. Red snapper are also targeted in the Western Australian Trap and Line Fishery, though not in very large quantities. Sea perch as a whole are marketed either gilled and gutted, whole or as fillets, as fresh chilled or frozen product. Northern Territory and Queensland sea perch are marketed locally (eg in Darwin, and on the Reef island and tourist resorts) and in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Recreational fishery: In Western Australia, the recreational fishery extends from the Houtman Abrolhos to Broome. Recreational fishing on the Great Barrier Reef is carried out by small vessels (from 3 m long) working inshore reefs and larger charter vessels working the more remote outer reefs. Recreational landings of 'redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are about the same as the commercial catch from the Reef. The record size for sea perch in Australian waters is 17.6 kg, from Western Australia (Australian Anglers Association records). Resource status: Lutjanids comprised 20-30% of the fish biomass in the mid-shelf area of the North West Shelf (115°30' and 118°30' E) during the 1960s and early 1970s (Ref. 28006). By 1983 however, they comprised less than 10% of the biomass following a period of intensive fishing by Taiwanese trawlers (Ref. 28006). In 1990, Queensland fishers considered that the 'redfish' and emperor resources in the Reef Line Fishery were in decline (Ref. 27262). Generally, the decline was concentrated very close to the coast, away from major commercial fishing activity on the Great Barrier Reef coral reefs - except possibly for Cairns (Ref. 27260). The catch rates and the size of reef fish caught by the offshore charter boat fleet on the Reef since 1963 until 1992 have remained fairly stable (Ref. 27260). Museum: LPPL JIF68 (TGT2258).

They frequently form mixed shoals with L. erythropterus. Juveniles tend to inhabit shallow inshore waters and larger fish live in deeper waters (Ref. 27260, 27264). Also Ref. 37816. Stock structure: A study (Ref. 27432) involving allozyme and mitochondrial DNA analysis of L. malabaricus has provided evidence of three stocks (North West Shelf, Gulf of Carpentaria and east coast of Queensland) existing across northern Australia, with little mixing or exchange of genes through the Torres Strait (Ref. 27432). However, more detailed work is required to confirm the proposed stock structure (Ref. 27432). Commercial fishery: In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, saddle-tail snapper are caught by demersal and semi-pelagic otter trawls, traps, droplines, and deepwaters handlines (Western Australia). In Queensland, they are also longlined. The fisheries operate all year. Saddle-tail snapper are more commonly caught by trawling in northern waters. Saddle-tail snapper are harvested by demersal otter trawling for fish on the North West Shelf, Timor Sea and Arafura Sea. They are the principal target species of domestic trawlers in the Arafura Sea and Timor Sea (Ref. 28010), and historically (1930s (Ref. 27275) to 1991) for Taiwanese and Thai pair trawl and stern trawl fleets fishing in northern Australia. Sea perch (mainly 'redfish') were a dominant group of fishes in Thai and Taiwanese trawler catches in the Arafura Sea and Timor Sea, comprising up to 30% of the total catch; and between 1985 and 1987 on the North West Shelf, sea perch were the third most important fish group taken by demersal foreign trawling.

The 'redfish' catch was dominated by saddle-tail snapper (70% by weight) and red snapper (24% by weight). Saddle-tail snapper are targeted by the domestic Northern Fish Trawl Fishery which as of 1993, operated in depths of 50 m offshore from prawn grounds in the Arafura Sea only, with vessels based at Gove and Karumba. Juvenile saddle-tail snapper are also a bycatch of the Northern Prawn Fishery. Lutjanus malabaricus was the most abundant fish caught in night trawls, and was a significant component of day trawls, in a 1994 (Ref. 9700) survey of demersal fish of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Ref. 27432). Saddle-tail snapper are caught in the Great Barrier Reef Reef Line Fishery as well as in east Queensland coastal waters. The Fishery operates all year between Torres Strait to south of the Swain Reefs and into Moreton Bay, with most of the catch being taken between Cardwell and Mackay (Ref. 27260). There are seasonal peaks in catch and effort - especially during the period August - October (Ref. 27260). 'Redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are targeted primarily at night. Handlines, large, deck-mounted, hand-operated reels and bottom set longlines are used, and baits include squid, oily fish and lower quality reef fish (Ref. 27262). As of 1993, the saddle-tail snapper catch in Queensland has increased. Saddle-tail snappers are also targeted in the Western Australian Trap and Line Fishery, though not in very large quantities. Sea perch as a whole are marketed either gilled and gutted, whole or as fillets, as fresh chilled or frozen product. Northern Territory and Queensland sea perch are marketed locally (eg in Darwin, and on the Reef island and tourist resorts) and in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Recreational fishery: In the Northern Territory, saddle-tail snapper are commonly caught inshore and on artificial reefs. Recreational fishing on the Great Barrier Reef is carried out by small vessels (from 3 m long) working inshore reefs and larger charter vessels working the more remote outer reefs. Recreational landings of 'redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are about the same as the commercial catch from the Reef.

By 1983 however, they comprised less than 10% of the biomass following a period of intensive fishing by Taiwanese trawlers (Ref. 28006). Saddle-tail snapper stocks in the Northern Fish Trawl Fishery were assessed in 1991 (Ref. 28010) and 1992. Stock biomass was estimated from research surveys and a yield-per-recruit analysis was used to derive sustainable yield estimates. The 1992 estimate of sustainable yield for the Arafura region was 3000-8000 t for saddle-tail snapper and 4000-10000 t for 'redfish' (including Timor snapper, L. timorensis). The large ranges of the yield estimates are due to various uncertainties in the assessment including lack of information on growth and mortality and uncertainty in the biomass estimates. In 1990, Queensland fishers considered that the 'redfish' and emperor resources in the Reef Line Fishery were in decline (Ref. 27262). Generally, the decline was concentrated very close to the coast, away from major commercial fishing activity on the Great Barrier Reef coral reefs - except possibly for Cairns (Ref. 27260).

There are seasonal peaks in catch and effort - especially during the period August - October (Ref. 27260). 'Redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are targeted primarily at night. Handlines, large, deck-mounted, hand-operated reels and bottom set longlines are used, and baits include squid, oily fish and lower quality reef fish (Ref. 27262). In 1980-81, red emperors were the main 'redfish' recorded in catches, comprising 17% of the total commercial catch around Cairns, 4% around Townsville and 5% around Mackay (Ref. 27260). In the Northern Territory, red emperors are targeted in the trap fishery operating in Timor Sea. The traps are of various designs with a single entrance. The traps are baited with oily fish such as pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus) placed inside bait boxes or bags. Tropical snappers (Pristipomoides species) and red emperors comprise nearly 50% each of the catch from the trap fishery, in which rock cod and other species of sea perch comprise the small bycatch. The 3 'redfish' species are also caught as a bycatch of the Northern Territory dropline fishery for tropical snapper. Red emperors are targeted in the Western Australian Trap and Line Fishery, which began on the North West Shelf in 1984 (Ref. 28006). Handlining had been carried out from boats working inshore and the islands before that year (Ref. 27266). The main area for trapping is now north of Broome and some fishing is also carried out off Port Hedland. Fish traps used in Western Australia are mostly circular ('O' traps) and are baited usually with pilchards. Red emperors are the dominant sea perch taken in the trap fishery (Ref. 27266). Sea perch as a whole are marketed either gilled and gutted, whole or as fillets, as fresh chilled or frozen product. Northern Territory and Queensland sea perch are marketed locally (eg in Darwin, and on the Reef island and tourist resorts) and in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. Recreational fishery: Red emperors are caught by recreational fishers using handlines and sometimes rod-and-line. The most common baits are cut fish flesh, pilchards and squid. In Western Australia, the recreational fishery extends from the Houtman Abrolhos to Broome. In the Northern Territory, red emperors are commonly caught offshore. Recreational fishing on the Great Barrier Reef is carried out by small vessels (from 3 m long) working inshore reefs and larger charter vessels working the more remote outer reefs. Recreational landings of 'redfish' on the Great Barrier Reef are about the same as the commercial catch from the Reef. Red emperors are caught relatively more commonly in the Cairns region (17% of the total recreational catch) than in areas further south such as Townsville and Mackay (Ref. 27260). The record size for sea perch in Australian waters is 17.6 kg, from Western Australia (Australian Anglers Association records). Resource status: Lutjanids comprised 20-30% of the fish biomass in the mid-shelf area of the North West Shelf (115°30' and 118°30' E) during the 1960s and early 1970s (Ref. 28006). By 1983 however, they comprised less than 10% of the biomass following a period of intensive fishing by Taiwanese trawlers (Ref. 28006). In 1990, Queensland fishers considered that the 'redfish' and emperor resources in the Reef Line Fishery were in decline (Ref. 27262). Generally, the decline was concentrated very close to the coast, away from major commercial fishing activity on the Great Barrier Reef coral reefs - except possibly for Cairns (Ref. 27260). The catch rates and the size of reef fish caught by the offshore charter boat fleet on the Reef from 1963 until 1992 remained fairly stable (Ref. 27260).

They inhabit waters from Hinchinbrook Island in Queensland to Barrow Island in Western Australia. They are occasionally found off the north coast of Tasmania, but no further south (Ref. 28578). Recorded from Shark Bay (Ref. 115274). Also found in Lord Howe I. (Ref. 8879, 75154). Stock structure: Tagging and genetic studies (Ref. 28578, 28584) have indicated the presence of several stocks or breeding populations of snapper in Australian waters. There is considerable overlap in the distributions of these populations. Commercial fishery: Snapper are fished commercially throughout their range. In Queensland, large numbers of juveniles are sometimes caught by demersal otter trawlers near reefs in Moreton Bay (Ref. 27645). In New South Wales, the main fishery is on the north coast around Coffs Harbour and Wooli (Ref. 28585). In Victoria, the main fishery is in Port Phillip Bay (80-90 % of the State's total catch), although small commercial catches are also taken from other bays and inlets and from open coastal waters (Ref. 26431). In South Australia, commercial fishing effort is concentrated in Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent. In Western Australia, snapper are fished from Esperance to Barrow Island but the major fishery targets stocks near Shark Bay. The Western Australian fishery is distinctly seasonal. In the north, 75% of the catch is taken in winter (June and July), while in southern areas, summer is the peak fishing season. In New South Wales, 70% of the snapper catch is harvested by trap fishers and the rest by fishers using bottom set longlines and handlines. In Victoria over 80% of the catch is taken on longlines, while in South Australia, snapper are caught using (in order of quantities) handlines, bottom set longlines, hauling nets, power hauling and large mesh gillnets. Most of the Western Australian catch is taken on handlines, although traps and droplines are also used. Large quantities of juveniles are often caught in prawn trawl nets in estuaries, although this is an incidental catch. Since 1988, considerable quantities of snapper caught in the Shark Bay fishery have been exported to Japan as whole chilled fish. Most of the Australian snapper catch is sold on the domestic market, particularly in Sydney where large quantities are freighted from interstate and some imported from New Zealand. Snapper are usually sold as fresh whole or gilled and gutted fish. Aquaculture: A study (Ref. 28588) reported that the growth of snapper in captivity can be increased to a rate acceptable for aquaculture. Recreational fishery: Snapper are an important recreational species, highly prized for both sport and eating (Ref. 28578, 27018). In New South Wales anglers fish both in estuaries and offshore, while in Victoria most recreational fishing effort takes place in Port Phillip and Western Port bays. In South Australia, most effort is concentrated on the inshore waters of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St. Vincent, particularly around artificial reefs in the central and northern areas. In Western Australia, the major areas fished are the inshore waters of Shark Bay and coastal waters in the south of the State. In Queensland, the recreational catch is estimated to be several times higher than the commercial catch (Ref. 30572). A lot of the recreational catch is undersized. Most of the recreational snapper catch is taken by handline or rod-and-line using pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus) for bait. Snapper are caught by both shore and boat-based anglers. The largest snapper recorded by the Australian Anglers Association up to 1993, was a 16.2 kg fish caught in Western Australia in 1988. The sizes of recreational catches of snapper are probably considerable. The angler catch of snapper for Coffs Harbour is probably equivalent to 25% of the commercial catch in that area (Ref. 28585). In Victoria, the recreational catch of snapper in Port Phillip Bay in 1982-83 was conservatively estimated at 112 t or 44% of the total catch from the Bay (Ref. 27018), and in 1983, Western Australian anglers caught an estimated 10% of the State's snapper catch from the Shark Bay region. Resource status: Commercial catch rates of snapper in New South Wales and Victoria have fallen in recent years while fishing effort has increased. It is not known whether this decline is due to natural population fluctuations, excessive fishing pressure or environmental degradation. The decline in the number of large fish in northern Spencer Gulf is due to excessive fishing effort (Ref. 28586). In Western Australia, there has been a reduction in the average size of fish caught in the trap and line fisheries. In Queensland, the commercial catch has fallen since 1992. The resource is over exploited in southern part of Queensland (Ref. 30572). Also Ref. 2156, 27296. Note on abudance in the early 1800s by Ref. 394: abundant, occured in schools in Shark Bay; was also abundant in Dick Hartog (island) where it was bait fished. ",+

The Reef Line Fishery is daytime based and conducted by individuals operating small dories or dinghies ('tender vessels') working to a mother ship. Generally, coral trout are caught in commercial quantities from Torres Strait to just south of Rockhampton (Ref. 27262). Catches peak in the waters off Mackay and only small catches are made south of Gladstone. Although coral trout are caught throughout the year, catches and fishing effort are higher from August to October (Ref. 26263). In north Queensland, coral trout are caught by shallow and deepwater handlining off the reef crests. They may also be caught using rod-and-reel and by trolling ('wogging'). Cut baits from oily fish such as tunas and mackerel (Scombridae), frozen pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus) from Western Australia and shark (Carcharhinus species), and also squid are commonly used (Ref. 27264). Fishers often target spawning aggregations of common coral trout and bluespot trout, and also seek 'plate-sized' trout about 35 cm FL. Coral trout are an excellent table fish marketed mostly fresh, gilled and gutted, or as fillets. Recreational fishery: In north Queensland waters, considerable quantities of coral trout are taken by handline and rod-and-reel. The fish are caught mainly during the day in depths to about 25 m (Ref. 27264). Coral trout are also caught by spearfishing to about 20 m depth. Small vessels are used on inshore reefs. Fishing in deeper water to 40 m is occasionally conducted from charter vessels (Ref. 27262). The quantity of coral trout taken in the recreational fishery in Queensland is estimated to be the same as, or more than, the quantity taken in the commercial fishery. The largest recorded coral trout caught by a recreational fisher was 23,600 g from Queensland (Australian Underwater Federation records). Resource status: In Queensland, there appears to be 'localised' over-fishing of bluespot trout on reefs near centres of population, and the average size of coral trout is smaller on reefs that are fished compared with the size of coral trout on closed reefs in the Capricorn Reefs area (Ref. 27276). Over the whole Great Barrier Reef however, coral trout densities until 1993, appear to have remained stable over a considerable time period. As of 1993, despite both recreational and commercial fisheries targeting the same species using the same gear and methods, it appeared that the resource had not been over-fished. However, fishing effort on coral trout is increasing from both fisheries. Also Ref. 2334, 4787, 33390, 37816. ",+

In Queensland, they are distributed from the Sir Charles Hardy Islands to Brisbane (Ref. 13465). On the Great Barrier Reef, common coral trout inhabit mid-shelf reefs (Ref. 6390). Also reported from the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands (Ref. 75154). Maximum densities are achieved in the Swains Reef and Capricorn-Bunker Reefs (Ref. 27404). Stock structure: As of 1993, no studies have been conducted on the stock structure of coral trout. Differences in maximum lengths of common coral trout populations between the Capricorn-Bunker Reefs and other Great Barrier Reef areas may indicate the existence of 2 stocks (Ref. 27404) although there is no known barrier to exchange between these areas. Commercial fishery: Common coral trout is fished on the Great Barrier Reef and at the Houtman Abrolhos by handline. Coral trout, in general, are the major Queensland commercial finfish, worth about A$8.2 million in 1989-90. They are one of the target species groups of the Queensland East Coast Reef Line Fishery and comprise 31-34% of the catch from that Fishery (Ref. 27262, 27263).

Fishers often target spawning aggregations of common coral trout and bluespot trout, and also seek 'plate-sized' trout about 35 cm FL. In contrast to Queensland, coral trout are a minor part of Western Australian and Northern Territory fisheries. Fish traps used in Western Australia are generally circular and they are usually baited with pilchards. Coral trout caught in traps range from 41 cm to 76 cm FL (Ref. 27266). Between 1979 and 1991, first Taiwanese, and latter Thai and Chinese, fleets operated a demersal trawl fishery in northern Australia from the North West Shelf to the Arafura Sea. They used pair trawlers and some stern trawlers. Australian stern trawlers entered the Arafura Sea fishery after 1987 and the North West Shelf fishery in 1989. Coral trout comprised 38% of the reported 'cod' catches in the demersal trawl fishery (based on an assessment of the Arafura Sea catches) and they are more abundant in catches on the North West Shelf to 21°S and 120°E. Fishing was carried out all year although fishing effort was concentrated on the North West Shelf from October to March (Ref. 27275).

They also inhabit the waters of Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Commercial fishery: The main fishery for silver trevally is located in New South Wales waters. Trevally are targeted by fishers using beach seines in bays, or from ocean beaches along the coast from Port Macquarie to the Victorian border. They are also caught in the New South Wales trap fishery which targets higher valued species such as snapper (Pagrus auratus) and ocean jackets (Nelusetta ayraudi). Small quantities of silver trevally are caught in estuaries using coastal set gillnets. Catches are also made by demersal otter trawlers targeting other species in the South East Fishery off southeastern Australia. Trawl catch rates are consistently low in the Fishery, e.g. total trawl catches ranged between 200 t and 400 t from 1985-86 to 1989-90. Most of the silver trevally trawl catch is taken from waters less than 100 m deep (Ref. 27735). Silver trevally are also a bycatch of the Southern Shark Fishery, although the level of catch is uncertain due to misreporting of warehous (Seriolella species) as silver trevally. Small quantities of silver trevally are also trolled in Tasmanian coastal waters. The New South Wales catch of silver trevally has increased since the 1980s when the low price obtained for silver trevally deterred fishers from targetting the species. Higher prices now encourage fishers to target silver trevally when the availability of other more valuable species is low. Silver trevally are sold mainly as whole fish on the domestic fresh fish market. Some of the catch is air freighted to Japan as fresh, chilled product. Recreational fishery: Silver trevally is a significant recreational species throughout the area it inhabits. The most common methods used to catch it are handlines and rod-and-line and most fish are caught by using baits of cut fish flesh, whole pilchards (Sardinops neopilchardus) or anchovies (Engraulis australis), squid, prawns (Penaeidae), crabs or cunjevoi (Pyura stolonifera) (Ref. 27128).
